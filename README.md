# NMAP_Port_Scanner
A basic level port scanner with Python and NMAP library.
Enter the target IP and program will scan and show open ports and basic info.
It has 3 Options to work with: 
  1- TCP Scan
  2- UDP Scan
  3- Comprehensive Scan

Whole idea of implementation is just to understand how NMAP and scan works.
